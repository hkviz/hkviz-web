## Goal of the research

The aim of our research is to investigate data visualization techniques used in players metrics for HollowKnight.

Thus, we want to gather gameplay data from players and visualize it in different ways.
We will then evaluate the visualizations with players and game developers in a follow up user study.
Your participation in this study will contribute to the advancement of knowledge on data visualization techniques in games,
and would be very welcome.

## Informed Consent Form: Please read carefully.

In this study, you will provide us with your gameplay data by using the mod to collect and upload data.
You have the opportunity to ask further questions before / after using the mod. The following information relates to the data collected by the mod.
All the personal information (like your email and account name of your chosen login provider) that we collect about you is kept strictly confidential.
Confidentiality will be respected subject to legal constraints and professional guidelines.
Visualizations of your gameplay data may appear in academic publications and may be shown to participants of user study evaluating the visualization.

Your gameplay data will be deleted at the end of the study unless you choose to keep your account for your personal use.

Visualizations will be anonymised and you will not be identified while visualizations are shown to other study participants and in any ensuing reports or publications.

**Your personal data will be processed and kept only for so long as it is required to conduct this research i.e. until the end of July 2024.
