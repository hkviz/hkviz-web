# About and credits

The <HKVizText /> mod and this website is developed by me, Oliver as part of my bachelor's thesis. It allows to upload your gameplay data from
the game Hollow Knight and visualize it in various ways. You can contact me on Discord @OliverGrack or per mail <MailLinkUnstyled />.

This project builds up from work from many other people:

## TeamCherry

[TeamCherry]("https://www.teamcherry.com.au/) of course for creating
[Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com/).
This website uses many of the assets from the original game and would of course not exist without the amazing work
TeamCherry have put into HollowKnight.

## MolaMolasses

[MolaMolasses](https://twitter.com/MolaMolasses/status/1153067442823823360) has created the unofficial maps for [Godhome](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Godhome)
and [White Palance](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/White_Palace) which are used on this website, to allow for
visualizations in these areas. Thank you, for letting me use your maps for this project.

## Hollow Knight Modding Community

The [Hollow Knight Modding Community](https://discord.com/servers/hollow-knight-modding-879125729936298015) has created many tools I have used to develop the mod.
Like:

-   [Modding API](https://github.com/hk-modding/api)
-   [Core.FsmUtil](https://github.com/hk-modding/HK.Core.FsmUtil)
-   [setup-hk](https://github.com/BadMagic100/setup-hk) by [BadMagic100](https://github.com/BadMagic100)

## n o o k

[n o o k](https://www.youtube.com/TheEmbracedOne) has created a map of Hollownest from
hundreds of thousands of screenshots. The map can be viewed at [www.hallownest.net](https://www.hallownest.net/).
The map is not yet used in this project, but I would like to allow visualizations on it in the future.
You may also want to checkout her game [Where Birds Go to Sleep](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1387640/).

Thank you n o o k for your amazing work, for your ideas, and for letting me use the map for this project!
