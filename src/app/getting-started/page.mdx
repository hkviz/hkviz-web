# Getting Started with <HKVizText />

This site tells you how you can get started with the <HKVizText /> mod to create a record analytics of your <a href="https://www.hollowknight.com" target="_blank">HollowKnight</a> gameplays and how you can view them on this site.

    return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>;
}

## 1. Install HollowKnight

First, you need to have HollowKnight installed on your computer. Mods can not be used on the Nintendo Switch, PS4, or Xbox One versions of HollowKnight.
You can buy HollowKnight at one of the following stores:

-   <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/" target="_blank">
        Steam
    </a>
-   <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/hollow_knight" target="_blank">
        GOG
    </a>
-   <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hollow-knight" target="_blank">
        Humble Bundle
    </a>

## 2. Install a Mod Manager

While you can install mods manually, its pretty tedious. Instead, you should install a mod installer.
There are a few available.

-   I recommend using <a href="https://themulhima.github.io/Lumafly/" target="_blank">the Lumafly mod manager</a> availible for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
    You can click the download button on the website, it should give you the correct installer.
-   If this mod manager doesn't work for you, you can try <a href="https://github.com/fifty-six/Scarab/releases/latest" target="_blank">Scarab Mod Manager</a>
    select one of the zip files depending on your operating system.

## 3. Install the <HKVizText /> mod

If you have chosen the Lumafly mod manager, you can install the <HKVizText /> mod
by <a href="https://themulhima.github.io/Lumafly/commands/download/?mods=HKViz">clicking here</a>

Alternatively, if you are using another mod manager, or the link did not work, search for 'HKViz' in your mod manager and click install.
While installing the mod, HollowKnight must be closed, otherwise the mod manager will not be able to install the mod.

## 4. Login to <HKVizText /> from the HollowKnight main menu

Once you have the mod installed, a Login button is displayed on the main menu of HollowKnight.
Click on it and follow the steps to create an account.

## 5. Start playing HollowKnight

Once logged in you can start playing HollowKnight. The mod will automatically record your gameplay, and upload it to <HKVizText />.
You can view your gameplay on <Link href="/">the start page</Link>.

The mod uploads analytics roughly every 5 minutes, so your gameplay might not be visible immediately.
When you go back to the main menu of HollowKnight, the mod will upload the last bit of gameplay,
and while display a small message in the bottom while it is uploading data.

## Optional: 6. Share your analytics with others

By default all your gameplay is set to private, so only you can see it. You can change this in the 'Run infos' tab while viewing your gameplay.

## Usage on Steamdeck

Currently installing mods on the steamdeck breaks all controller inputs.
You can fix this by disabling the 'native controller' option in the HollowKnight Options > Controller
{/* (https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/v9ibgz/can_you_mod_hollow_knight_on_steam_deck/) */}

Additionally, the login button does not currently work, while in game mode.

-   Use the desktop mode by pressing the Steam button > Power > Switch to Desktop.
-   Open HollowKnight (A icon should be visible on your desktop, alternatively you can search for)
-   Set the fullscreen mode to 'Windowed' in the HollowKnight Options > Video
-   Then you can login to <HKVizText /> from the main menu of HollowKnight.
-   After the login, close HollowKnight and switch back to game mode.
-   Playing HollowKnight and using the mod now should work as expected.

(I hope to fix this in the near future).
