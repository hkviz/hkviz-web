# How to analyze a gameplay with the <HKVizText /> visualizations

Here you learn how to use the different parts of the <HKVizText /> gameplay analytics page.
It is accessible by clicking on one of your gameplays on the <Link href="/">start page</Link> or by viewing a gameplay from the <Link href="/run">public gameplays page</Link>.

If you want to learn how to record the analytics while playing <a href="https://hollowknight.com">Hollow Knight</a>

## Overview

<Mouse className="inline-block h-4 w-4" /> Click on the section you want to know more about:

<OverviewScreenshot />

## Contents

## Map

The map forms the center of the analytics page. It displays the game map.

The map is able to display player movement as traces, show which rooms are visited and allows displaying other information by recoloring the map itself.

### <Spline className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 inline-block"/>Player movement and traces

<ReflowRow>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Animated</ReflowCellHeader>
        <TracesAnimatedScreenshot />
        Shows the last 4 minutes of player's movement as a trace. Positions further in the past are faded out.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>All</ReflowCellHeader>
        <TracesAllScreenshot />
        Shows the player's movement of the complete gameplay at once.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Hidden</ReflowCellHeader>
        <TracesNoneScreenshot />
        Hides the trace. This can be useful, if you want to <a href="#map-coloring-by-variables">look at a variable on the map</a>, without the trace covering it.
    </ReflowCell>

</ReflowRow>

### <LayoutDashboard className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 inline-block"/>Room visibility

The room visibility option within the map options controlls which rooms are shown on the map.
You can choose between three options:

<ReflowRow>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Animated</ReflowCellHeader>
        <RoomVisibilityAnimatedVideo />
        Rooms appear once they are visited in the gameplay, based on the time selected in the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>. 
        
        Great to see the progression of the gameplay.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Visited</ReflowCellHeader>
        <RoomVisibilityVisitedVideo />
        All rooms visited at any time in the gameplay are shown. Not impacted by the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>. 
        
        Useful to <a href="#map-coloring-by-variables">analyze variables by recoloring the map</a>.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>All</ReflowCellHeader>
        <RoomVisibilityAllVideo />
        Even rooms not visitied in the gameplay at all are shown. 
        
        This can allow to find unvisited rooms, which have been missed in a gameplay.
    </ReflowCell>

</ReflowRow>

### <Palette className="w-5 h-5 mr-2 inline-block"/>Map coloring by variables

<RoomAnalyticsScreenshot />

By hovering over a room on the map, you can see the values of the variables for that room. Such as the time spent in the
room and the number of deaths. Additionally selected room and area is highlighted below the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>.

To stop the shown room from changing, you can pin it with the <Pin className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Pin" />-button in the room analytics panel or by clicking a room on the map.

By clicking on the <Palette className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Color" />-button, you can choose a variable to color the map by.
A single click will use a linear color scale, a second click will switch to an exponential color scale.

<ReflowRow>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Linear color scale</ReflowCellHeader>
        <ColorModeLinearTableScreenshot />
        <ColorModeLinearScreenshot />
        The first click on the <Palette className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Color" />-button will color the map by the selected variable using a linear color scale.
        This works best for variables like time spent in a room (where the values are distributed evenly).
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Exponential color scale</ReflowCellHeader>
        <ColorModeExpTableScreenshot />
        <ColorModeExpScreenshot />
        A second click on the <Palette className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Color" />-button will switch to an exponential color scale.

        For many variables, there will be a small number of rooms with a high value and a large number of rooms with a low values.
        Using an exponential color scale will make the differences in the low values more visible.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Area color</ReflowCellHeader>
        <ColorModeAreaTableScreenshot />
        <ColorModeAreaScreenshot />
        Clicking the <Palette className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Color" />-button a third time will switch back to color the map by the colors used in the game.
    </ReflowCell>

</ReflowRow>

Additional color scales are available from the dropdown menu displayed at the top right of the map, after selecting a variable by clicking its <Palette className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Color" />-button.

### Colluseum, Pantehons and other special rooms

<SpoilerWrapper title="Show late game spoilers">
    The ingame map has been extended to include some areas not displayed on the map in the game.
    Some buildings and doors are displayed at a single spot on the map, but some still contain information about each
    room inside.

    **The Colosseum of Fools**:

    The Colosseum displays a sign for each trial, allowing to see room analytics for each trial.
    Such as how often one has died in each trial.

    <ColosseumScreenshot />


    **Godhome**:

    The Godhome displays a information for each pantheon at its door.
    By selecting a pantehon, one can also select a boss, to look just at the room analytics for that fight.

     <GodhomeScreenshot />

     Similarly buildings like the Black Egg Temple and Bretta's House are displayed at a single spot on the map, but contain information about each room inside.

</SpoilerWrapper>

## Splits

<SplitsScreenshot />

The splits view provides a quick overview of what happened in a gameplay.
It shows the times of events of the following types:

<SplitsList />

By toggling the checkboxes corresponding to the event types, the splits can be filtered to only show the events of interest.

Hovering over a split will highlight the room of the event on the <a href="#map">map</a>, and display a marker on the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>.

## Time charts

Hovering over a chart will show a marker on the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>, the current room of the hovered time is highlighted on the <a href="#map">map</a>.

## Timeline

The timeline allows scrolling through a gameplay, to see the player location and room visibility at different points in time.
On the right of the timeline the speed of the animation can be adjusted.

<TimelineScreenshot />

At the bottom of the timeline, the color of visitied rooms is displayed. By <a href="#map-coloring-by-variables">selecting a room on the map</a>, the color codes of the selected room and area are enlarged.
This can make it easier to find the time a specific area was visited.
