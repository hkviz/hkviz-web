# How to analyze a gameplay with the <HKVizText /> visualizations

<SpoilerWarningEarlyGame />

Here you learn how to use the different parts of the <HKVizText /> gameplay analytics page.
It is accessible by clicking on one of your gameplays on the <Link href="/">start page</Link> or by viewing a gameplay from the <Link href="/run">public gameplays page</Link>.

If you want to learn how to record the analytics while playing {<ExternalLinkMdx href="https://hollowknight.com">Hollow Knight</ExternalLinkMdx>}
checkout the <Link href="/guide/install">mod install guide</Link>

## Overview

<Mouse className="inline-block h-4 w-4" /> Click on the section you want to know more about:

<OverviewScreenshot />

## Contents

## Map

The map forms the center of the analytics page. It is very similar to the in-game map, but with some modifications.

The map is able to display player movement as traces, show which rooms are visited and allows displaying other information by recoloring the map itself.

### <Spline className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 inline-block"/>Player movement and traces

<ReflowRow>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Animated</ReflowCellHeader>
        <TracesAnimatedScreenshot />
        Shows the last 4 minutes of player's movement as a trace. Positions further in the past are faded out.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>All</ReflowCellHeader>
        <TracesAllScreenshot />
        Shows the player's movement of the complete gameplay at once.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Hidden</ReflowCellHeader>
        <TracesNoneScreenshot />
        Hides the trace. This can be useful, if you want to <a href="#map-coloring-by-variables">look at a variable on the map</a>, without the trace covering it.
    </ReflowCell>

</ReflowRow>

### <LayoutDashboard className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 inline-block"/>Room visibility

The room visibility option within the map options controls which rooms are shown on the map.
You can choose between three options:

<ReflowRow>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Animated</ReflowCellHeader>
        <RoomVisibilityAnimatedVideo />
        Rooms appear once they are visited in the gameplay, based on the time selected in the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>. 
        
        Great to see the progression of the gameplay.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Visited</ReflowCellHeader>
        <RoomVisibilityVisitedVideo />
        All rooms visited at any time in the gameplay are shown. Not impacted by the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>. 
        
        Useful to <a href="#map-coloring-by-variables">analyze variables by recoloring the map</a>.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>All</ReflowCellHeader>
        <RoomVisibilityAllVideo />
        Even rooms not visitied in the gameplay at all are shown. 
        
        This can allow to find unvisited rooms, which have been missed in a gameplay.
    </ReflowCell>

</ReflowRow>

### <Palette className="w-5 h-5 mr-2 inline-block"/>Map coloring by variables

<RoomAnalyticsScreenshot />

By hovering over a room on the map, you can see the values of the variables for that room. Such as the time spent in the
room and the number of deaths. Additionally the selected room and area is highlighted in the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>.

{<LinkableParagraph id="room-pin">
To stop the shown room from changing by hovering over them, you can pin it with the <Pin className="inline-block h-4 w-4" aria-label="Pin" />-button in the room analytics panel or by clicking a room on the
map.

</LinkableParagraph>}

By clicking on the <Palette className="inline-block h-4 w-4" aria-label="Color" />
-button, you can choose a variable to color the map by. A single click will use a linear color scale, a second click will
switch to an exponential color scale.

<ReflowRow>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Linear color scale</ReflowCellHeader>
        <ColorModeLinearTableScreenshot />
        <ColorModeLinearScreenshot />
        The first click on the <Palette className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Color" />-button will color the map by the selected variable using a linear color scale.
        This works best for variables like time spent in a room (where the values are distributed evenly).
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Exponential color scale</ReflowCellHeader>
        <ColorModeExpTableScreenshot />
        <ColorModeExpScreenshot />
        A second click on the <Palette className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Color" />-button will switch to an exponential color scale.

        For many variables, there will be a small number of rooms with a high value and a large number of rooms with a low values.
        Using an exponential color scale will make the differences in the low values more visible.
    </ReflowCell>
    <ReflowCell>
        <ReflowCellHeader>Area color</ReflowCellHeader>
        <ColorModeAreaTableScreenshot />
        <ColorModeAreaScreenshot />
        Clicking the <Palette className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Color" />-button a third time will switch back to color the map by the colors used in the game.
    </ReflowCell>

</ReflowRow>

Additional color scales are available from the dropdown menu displayed at the top right of the map, after selecting a variable by clicking its <Palette className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" aria-label="Color" />-button.

### <Tent className="w-5 h-5 mr-2 inline-block" />Special rooms

The map in <HKVizText /> has a few modifications compared to the in-game map, to allow to analyze the gameplay in more areas.
Like added maps for Godhome, White Palace and Birthplace. Additionally a few other modifications have been made:

#### Buildings

<BuildingsColormapScreenshot />

Some parts of the Hollow Knight world are not represented on the Map directly, but are just hinted at by a building or door.
For <HKVizText /> these have been cut out from the game sprites, to allow seeing analytics for these buildings inidividually.

In the game, the player location is not displayed when inside on of these buildings.
In <HKVizText /> the player movement is displayed ontop of the buildings.

#### Multi-room buildings

<SubroomsScreenshot />

Some buildings contain multiple rooms, on the analytics are displayed for all rooms inside the building together.
(e.g. the number of deaths in the building is the sum over all rooms and the 'first visited at' map is the time the first room of the building has been visited).

By clicking on the building on the map, the analytics for each room inside can be displayed individually by using the buttons displayed for each room inside the building.

<SpoilerWrapper title="Spoilers: show list of all multi-room buildings">
    Other examples for multi-room buildings on the map are:
    <li>
        {
            <ExternalLinkMdx
                href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Forgotten_Crossroads#Sub-Area:_Temple_Of_The_Black_Egg"
                target="_blank"
            >
                Black Egg Temple
            </ExternalLinkMdx>
        }
    </li>
    <li>
        {
            <ExternalLinkMdx href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Deepnest#Sub-area:_Beast's_Den" target="_blank">
                Beasts Den
            </ExternalLinkMdx>
        }
    </li>
    <li>
        {
            <ExternalLinkMdx href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Greenpath#Sub-area:_Stone_Sanctuary" target="_blank">
                Stone Sancturary
            </ExternalLinkMdx>
        }
    </li>
    <li>
        {
            <ExternalLinkMdx href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Dirtmouth#The_Grimm_Troupe's_Tents" target="_blank">
                Grimms Tent
            </ExternalLinkMdx>
        }
    </li>
    {
        <li>
            The pantehons described in the <a href="#godhome">Godhome</a> section.
        </li>
    }
</SpoilerWrapper>

#### Colosseum

<SpoilerWrapper title="Show colosseum spoilers">
Unlike on the ingame map, each trial of the colosseum has its own sign on the map. Allowing to see room analytics, such as how often one has died in each of them.
<ColosseumScreenshot />

</SpoilerWrapper>

#### Godhome

<SpoilerWrapper title="Show spoilers for Godhome">
The Godhome displays information for each pantheon / boss rush at its door.
By clicking on one of the doors on the map, one sees the overal analytics of the selected pantehon.
Analytics can also be displayed for each boss individually, by clicking on one of the bosses above the analytics, similar to other <a href="#multi-room-buildings">multi-room buildings</a>.
<GodhomeScreenshot />

</SpoilerWrapper>

## Splits

<SplitsScreenshot />

The splits view provides a quick overview of what happened in a gameplay.
It shows the times of events of the following types:

<SplitsList />

By toggling the checkboxes corresponding to the event types, the splits can be filtered to only show the events of interest.

Hovering over a split will highlight the room of the event on the <a href="#map">map</a>, and display a marker on the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>.

## Time-based charts

The time-based charts show some variables over time, such as the completion percentage, geo, number of collected grubs.

Hovering over a chart will show a marker on the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a> to highlight the hovered timepoint,
additionally the room the player is in is highlighted on the map while hovering <a href="#map">map</a>.

**Shortcuts in time-based charts**

| Shortcut                | Action                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ctrl + Click            | Move the timeline to the timepoint hovered on the chart |
| Drag from left to right | zoom into the selected timespan                         |
| Click                   | Zoom out                                                |

<FloatClear />

### <GeoChartDocIcon />Geo chart

<GeoChartScreenshot />

The Geo chart shows geo over time. By default it shows the geo that the player has at the moment, and the potential geo the player can gain by defeating the shade and by selling relicts.

<GeoChartDocVars />

Hint: You can find out when money has been lost by failing to defeat the shade, by finding the spots where the 'Shade Geo' decreases without the 'Inventory Geo' increasing.

<FloatClear />

### <HealthChartDocIcon />Health chart

<HealthChartScreenshot />

The <ExternalLinkMdx href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Knight#Health">health</ExternalLinkMdx> chart shows the masks over time.
Since health does change very frequently, this chart is most useful when zooming in closely.

<HealthChartDocVars />

<FloatClear />

### <SoulChartDocIcon />Soul chart

<SoulChartScreenshot />

The <ExternalLinkMdx href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Soul">soul</ExternalLinkMdx> chart shows soul over time.
Since just like health, soul does change very frequently, this chart is most useful when zooming in closely.

<SoulChartDocVars />

<FloatClear />

### <CompletionChartDocIcon />Completion chart

<CompletionChartScreenshot />

The <ExternalLinkMdx href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Completion_(Hollow_Knight)">completion</ExternalLinkMdx> chart shows the completion percentage over time.

<CompletionChartDocVars />

<FloatClear />

### <GrubsChartDocIcon />Grubs chart

<GrubsChartScreenshot />

The <ExternalLinkMdx href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Grub">Grub</ExternalLinkMdx> chart shows the number of grubs collected over time, and for how many grubs the reward has been collected.

<GrubsChartDocVars />

<FloatClear />
## Timeline

The timeline allows scrolling through a gameplay, to see the player location and room visibility at different points in time.
On the right of the timeline the speed of the animation can be adjusted.

<TimelineScreenshot />

At the bottom of the timeline, the color of visitied rooms is displayed. By <a href="#map-coloring-by-variables">selecting a room on the map</a>, the color codes of the selected room and area are enlarged.
This can make it easier to find the time a specific area was visited.
