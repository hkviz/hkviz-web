# Website v3.0.0

**(To be released)**

-   **Room analytics based on timeline position**:
    Following confusions in the user study, the room analytics now updates based on the timeline position, but can also be set to display the gameplay totals like they did before.
    This also impacts the feature that colors the map based on a metric (the choropleth feature).
-   **Watcher Knights in splits**:
    A edge case which was overlooked caused the Watcher Knights not to be included in the splits.
-   **Footer hides when looking at the map**:
    The footer now hides when looking at the map, since many user study participants found it annoying to have mutliple scrolling areas within one another.
    This hopefully makes using the dashboard more pleasant.
-   **Dreamgate icon on the map**:
    The map now always displays the current location of the dreamgate. (Thank you for the idea to one of our study participants!)
-   **Pin button more visible if enabled**:
    Previously a enabled pin button was barely distinguishable from when it was disabled. Now it has a light background color when its enabled. (Also a change following user study feedback)
-   **Rewrote remaining ui and backend in solid-start**:
    while the previous version was a mix of NextJS for most pages, and SolidJS for the visualization dashboard.
    This version is now fully SolidJS, which will make the build process a little more streamlined, and allow for better code sharing between.
