# Website 3.1.0

**2026-02-04**

- **Search runs by title**: a searchbar was added to public runs, and to pages of players
- **Redesigned player page**: when clicking on a player of a gameplay, the page listing all gameplays of a player has been slightly redesigned.
- **Bug fixes**: Fixed bug where player page would not work once selecting a filter that resulted in no gameplays.

# Website 3.0.1

- **Better error recovery when uploading data**:
  As the website version 3.0.0 or later now provides better information and error handling when a file upload is reattempted,
  which previously succeeded in early steps of the upload,
  the upload can now recover from the error and continue where it left off.

- **Room analytics based on timeline position**:
  Following confusions in the user study, the room analytics now updates based on the timeline position, but can also be set to display the gameplay totals like they did before.
  This also impacts the feature that colors the map based on a metric (the choropleth feature).
- **Watcher Knights in splits**:
  A edge case which was overlooked caused the Watcher Knights not to be included in the splits.
- **Footer hides when looking at the map**:
  The footer now hides when looking at the map, since many user study participants found it annoying to have multiple scrolling areas within one another.
  This hopefully makes using the dashboard more pleasant.
- **Dreamgate icon on the map**:
  The map now always displays the current location of the Dreamgate. (Thank you for the idea to one of our study participants!)
- **Pin button more visible if enabled**:
  Previously a enabled pin button was barely distinguishable from when it was disabled. Now it has a light background color when its enabled. (Also a change following user study feedback)
- **Better error handling when mod uploads data**:
  Using mod version 1.6.0.0 or later, when a file upload is reattempted, which previously succeeded in early steps of the upload,
  the upload can now recover from the error and continue where it left off.
- **Rewrote remaining ui and backend in solid-start**:
  while the previous version was a mix of NextJS for most pages, and SolidJS for the visualization dashboard.
  This version is now fully SolidJS, which will make the build process a little more streamlined, and allow for better code sharing between.
