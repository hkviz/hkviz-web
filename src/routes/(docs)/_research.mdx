# Research

<HKVizText /> has been developed to allow research on map-based player-analytics for Metroidvania games, in particular
Hollow Knight. So far, this project resulted in 2 publications:

## Player-Centric Data Visualization for Metroidvania Games: Insights and Use Cases: The Case of Hollow Knight (2025)

In a interview and insight-based user-study with 12 participants we study insights gained from the dashboard and use cases that could be enabled by analytics tools in Metroidvania games.
