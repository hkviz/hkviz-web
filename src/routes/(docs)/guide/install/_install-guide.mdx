# How to use the <HKVizText />-Mod to record analytics of your gameplays

Here you learn how to install the mod, to create and record analytics of you playing {<ExternalLinkMdx href="https://www.hollowknight.com">Hollow Knight</ExternalLinkMdx>}.

## Contents

## 0. Need help?

If you need help installing the mod, feel free to ask in the {<ExternalLinkMdx href={HOLLOW_KNIGHT_MODDING_DISCORD_URL}>Hollow Knight Modding Discord Server</ExternalLinkMdx>} inside the #hkviz channel or via email <MailLinkUnstyled />.

## 1. Install Hollow Knight

First, you need to have Hollow Knight installed on your Windows, Linux or Mac computer, laptop or handheld. Mods can not be used on the Nintendo Switch, PS4, or Xbox One versions of Hollow Knight.
You can buy Hollow Knight at one of the following stores:

<HollowKnightStores />

## 2. Install a Mod Manager

The easiest way to install mods is using a mod installer.
There are a few available.

-   I recommend using {<ExternalLinkMdx href="https://themulhima.github.io/Lumafly/" target="_blank">the Lumafly Mod Manager</ExternalLinkMdx>} available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
    You can click the download button on the website, it should give you the correct installer.
-   If this mod manager doesn't work for you, you can try {<ExternalLinkMdx href="https://github.com/fifty-six/Scarab/releases/latest" target="_blank">Scarab Mod Manager</ExternalLinkMdx>}
    select one of the zip files depending on your operating system.

## 3. Install the <HKVizText /> mod

If you have chosen the Lumafly mod manager, you can install the <HKVizText /> mod
by {<ExternalLinkMdx href="https://themulhima.github.io/Lumafly/commands/download/?mods=HKViz">clicking here</ExternalLinkMdx>}

Alternatively, if you are using another mod manager, or the link did not work, search for 'HKViz' in your mod manager and click install.
While installing the mod, HollowKnight must be closed, otherwise the mod manager will not be able to install the mod.

## 4. Login to <HKVizText /> from the HollowKnight main menu

Once you have the mod installed, a Login button is displayed on the main menu of HollowKnight.
Click on it and follow the steps to create an account.
The button will disappear once you are logged in, and can be accessed from the mod settings afterwards.

## 5. Start playing HollowKnight

Once logged in you can start playing HollowKnight. The mod will automatically record your gameplay, and upload it to <HKVizText />.
You can view your gameplay on <A href="/">the start page</A>.

The mod uploads analytics roughly every 5 minutes, so your gameplay might not be visible immediately.
When you go back to the main menu of HollowKnight, the mod will upload the last bit of gameplay,
and while display a small message in the bottom while it is uploading data.

## Optional: 6. Share your analytics with others

By default all your gameplays are set to private, so only you can see it.
You can change this for each gameplay individually by clicking on the lock icon on the left of a gameplay on the start page.

## Usage on Steam Deck

Currently installing mods on the Steam Deck may break all controller inputs.
You can fix this by disabling the 'native controller' option in the HollowKnight Options > Controller.
{/* (https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/v9ibgz/can_you_mod_hollow_knight_on_steam_deck/) */}

Additionally, the login button does not currently work, while in game mode.

-   Use the desktop mode by pressing the Steam button > Power > Switch to Desktop.
-   Open HollowKnight (A icon should be visible on your desktop, alternatively you can search for)
-   Set the fullscreen mode to 'Windowed' in the HollowKnight Options > Video
-   Then you can login to <HKVizText /> from the main menu of HollowKnight.
-   After the login, close HollowKnight and switch back to game mode.
-   Playing HollowKnight and using the mod now should work as expected.
